Fork from [nickveys`s pysubwcrev](https://github.com/nickveys/pysubwcrev) to add [SubWCRev nightly](http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html) version support.

[TortoiseSVN's](http://tortoisesvn.net) [SubWCRev](http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html) app is windows-only. For those developing cross-platform apps, it's nice to have a command-line compatible alternative to swap into the build process. Only dependencies are Python and pysvn.

Also contains [SubWCRev](http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html) nightly version support.

Also added some extend tag:
WCLCREV 	last commit reversion
